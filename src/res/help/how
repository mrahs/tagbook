# How to Start
## TagBook is very easy to use.
1. Once TagBook starts up, you can open an existing book or create a new one from Book menu.
2. Once a book has been opened, you can add new bookmarks from Bookmark menu.
3. Make sure you add tags to your bookmarks to use them in your search queries.

The GUI was designed to be minimal, intuitive and feature rich.
