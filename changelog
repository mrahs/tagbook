0.3b
    Several bug fixes (some are important!)
	About Dialog: fixed license link
	Tag Dialog: changed button text from 'OK' to 'Done'
    Remove manual lock feature (caused confusion)
    Remove zoom feature (almost useless)
    Menu: rename database to book (common sense, right!)
    Add Dialog: rename address field to data (hoping to reduce confusion)
    Menu -> Book: rename menu item 'Load' to 'Open' (common sense!)
